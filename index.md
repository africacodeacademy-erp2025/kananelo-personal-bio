## Journey
### Early Life
I first fell in love with software development during a high school subject called **Web Authoring**. After school, I spent my afternoons and weekends herding sheep. In that time, my head was always down, glued to my phone as I jumped between YouTube tutorials and a mobile code editor. Those long hours are what got me started into web design, effectively opening my mind to more in the industry.

What really captivated me was the process of imagining an idea, strategizing its design, and then bringing it to life on the screen. That spark of creativity has driven me ever since, turning those early “sheep-side” webpages into a lifelong passion for building meaningful applications.

### Education and Career
At Botho University, I’ve focused on both the theory and practice of computing—earning six Dean’s Awards along the way. I sharpened my UI/UX skills in hackathons (including the ITU Blockchain Secure Authentication challenge) and led the design of projects like a Health Emergency Management System.

In April 2025, I was honored to be invited as a **youth panelist at the National Technology & Innovation Symposium** hosted at Limkokwing University, where I represented Botho University to discuss the role of youth in shaping Africa’s digital future.

### Goals
- Complete the ACA Engineering Residency Program and come out a better individual, and engineer.
- Master backend, thus moving into the Full-Stack category
- Learn Machine Learning and AI tools extensively
